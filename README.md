# Getting Started Examples
## Solace REST Messaging API

These tutorials will get you up to speed and sending messages with Solace technology as quickly as possible. There are two ways you can get started:

- If your company has Solace message routers deployed, contact your middleware team to obtain the host name or IP address of a Solace message router to test against, a username and password to access it, and a VPN in which you can produce and consume messages.
- If you do not have access to a Solace message router, you will need to go through the “[Set up a VMR](http://docs.solace.com/Solace-VMR-Set-Up/Setting-Up-VMRs.htm)” tutorial to download and install the software.
